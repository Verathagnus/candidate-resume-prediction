First, the required libraries such as nltk, numpy, pandas, sklearn etc. were imported. 
The dataset was loaded using pandas dataframe.
The train dataset consisted of the Candidate ID and Match Percentage.
The train resume directly was added to the ID and the .pdf extension at the end to get the location of the corresponding resume.
Then tika library was imported for extracting the pdf text from each pdf, cleaned and added to a new column the dataframe, text.
Same was done for the test datset.
Then, tokenizer was called on the text column to get the encoded column.
This was passed to a linear regression model and it was used to generate prediction of Match Percentage from the test text column after tokenizing.
A new dataframe was created to get the Candidate ID column from test and Match Percentage from predicted output.
